# MKS-TOOL
MKS TOOL is a tool that allows you to quickly modify the display UI and configuration files using a graphical interface (currently only supports MKS Robin series boards).

Now there are two versions of MKS TOOL, one is for installing in windows, the other is web version. Web version is independent with OS, so no matter you use Windows, Ubuntu, MacOS, you can use the web version throught the browser. Our follow-up mainly focuses on web version development.

## For Web Version Usage
1. Visit the address with a browser: https://baizhongyun.cn/home/mkstoolview
2. According to the wizard, select the board you use, the firmware you use...
3. From the ui interface, you can modify the configuration files, modify the display icons, export the files to flash...

## For Installed Version Usage

1. Two ways:
 - Download the released installation file from [https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-TOOL/releases](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-TOOL/releases) and then install it.(only supports Windows OS) 
 - Directly run the "mainFrame.py" with Python. This requires you to install Python2.7.x, and you must have some experience using Python, because you need to install some libraries halfway. 
2. Open the tool, choose the type of board+lcd and language and continue.

3. Now you can modify the images of each page or modify the configuration file.![](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-TOOL/blob/master/Images/step1.png)

### Modify images
 - It is recommended to load the factory image template first and modify it on this basis. Of cause, you can also import your current image folders("mks_pic" folder) by clicking "Import" to modify.
 - Select the page you want to modify in the left column, select the image you want to modify on the right, and then replace the pictures in the three "+" places below. Note that the pixels of the replacement image should meet the requirements. At present, the pixel requirement for the 2.4/2.8/3.2-inch screen is 78x104; for the 3.5-inch screen, the pixel is 117x140. Also, if the picture at the same position has serval state, you can modify different pictures for each state (so below are 3 "+", there are at most 3 states).
